Providing liquidity involves several risks:
1. IMPERMANENT LOSS: If market odds shift significantly, your LP position may lose value relative to simply holding capital
2. MARKET RISK: If the market resolves with extreme odds, slippage could exceed fee income
3. LIQUIDITY RISK: You may not be able to withdraw immediately if the market is under heavy trading
4. REGULATORY RISK: Prediction markets face regulatory uncertainties in various jurisdictions

Fee income typically offsets small IL losses, but high-volatility markets carry elevated risk.
